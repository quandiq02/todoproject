# todoproject

This project was written in the JavaScript programming language.
The project is a task scheduler that can be added, changed and deleted. The first thing you need to do when entering the project is to register because without this you can’t add notes in any way. User data is stored in localstorage because the project was made only by me, and I don’t I know about storing data in the database, I decided to use localstorage. After registration, you are directed to the authorization window. After authorization, you can add notes and manage them. There are 3 note states
1)Inprocess
2)Important
3)Done
And all this can be changed via drag and drop.
There is also a window for changing your password, login, and information about yourself.
There is also an admin panel where you can view all information about users and their notes. Change and add administrators, delete users and change their data.
All data is stored in localstorage and when the page is reloaded, all data is stored and does not disappear.
